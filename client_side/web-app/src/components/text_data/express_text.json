However, similar to other news sources around the start of 2022 the war in Ukraine became by far the most frequent headline topic, and this was the 3rd most common topic overall, despite having barely any coverage until mid-2021.\nThe royals the most frequent category within the top 10 topics. Kate Middleton and her fashion/jewellery were the second most popular topic, but Meghan Markle made it into two of the top 10 clusters, number 4 (which centred on her supposed effect on relationships between other family members, using words like 'rift' and 'Megxit') and number 7 (which used similar language but was more focused on her as an individual). The potential for abdication was the 10th most popular topic, frequently mentioning Prince William and becoming a bigger topic as time went on.\nOther than these, the top topics covered cleaning hacks, football, television and tennis.\nOther than the royals, individuals who were defining parts of the top topics were Putin, Manchester Utd. manager Ole Gunnar Solskj√¶r and tennis players Federer and Alcaraz.",
